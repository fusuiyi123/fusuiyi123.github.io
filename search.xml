    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I just went back to my hotel from LinkedIn onsite interview. It could be my last onsite interview of my first full time job seeking. Honestly speaking, finding a job was extremely frustrating and painful. But as Ray wrote in his book PRINCIPLES, “Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life — you have the opportunity and to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but confortable delusion. It is a chance to identify your weakness and grow up.”In retrospect, I attended onsite interview at MathWork, Amazon, Bloomberg, Walmart Lab and LinkedIn. I withdrew interview invitation from Twilio. And there were many other phone/screen interviews as well. As I kept rejecting by companies one another, I identified and improved my weakness — negligence, lack of knowledge in data structure, algorithm, computer networking and operation system, communication skills. I cried and grew up. It was my girlfriend Danni who hugged and comforted me when I was upset. She also helped prepare the interview materials for each company and provieded feedbacks and suggestions for my each interview. I was so lucky to have her. I hope I am also the person who is supporting her when she is in adversity. I love her.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Danni is taking Comp580 at Rice. She is learning to analyze the expected cost of linear probing which is used to handle the collision in hashing. I want to share some interesting results without diving into details.Therom: With 3-independent hashing we can prove an O(logn) expected costs of look up.Therom: With 5-independent hashing we can prove an O(1) expected costs of look up.The proof are basically propability and statistics, it needs to use Chebyshev’s Inequalities, 4th moment bound and the variable independence derived from the 3/5-indenpendent hashing. If interested, this stanford lecture note is very useful.]]></content>
