I just went back to my hotel from LinkedIn onsite interview. It could be my last onsite interview of my first full time job seeking. Honestly speaking, finding a job was extremely frustrating and painful. But as Ray wrote in his book *PRINCIPLES*, "Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life — you have the opportunity and to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but confortable delusion. It is a chance to identify your weakness and grow up."

In retrospect, I attended onsite interview at MathWork, Amazon, Bloomberg, Walmart Lab and LinkedIn. I withdrew interview invitation from Twilio. And there were many other phone/screen interviews as well. As I kept rejecting by companies one another, I identified and improved my weakness — negligence, lack of knowledge in data structure, algorithm, computer networking and operation system, communication skills. I cried and grew up.  
  
It was my girlfriend Danni who hugged and comforted me when I was upset. She also helped prepare the interview materials for each company and provieded feedbacks and suggestions for my each interview. I was so lucky to have her. I hope I am also the person who is supporting her when she is in adversity. I love her.
