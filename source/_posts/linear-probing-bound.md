Danni is taking [Comp580](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/COMP480_580_Spring19/index.html) at Rice. She is learning to analyze the expected cost of linear probing which is used to handle the collision in hashing. I want to share some interesting results without diving into details.  
**Therom:** With 3-independent hashing we can prove an O(logn) expected costs of look up.  
**Therom:** With 5-independent hashing we can prove an O(1) expected costs of look up.  
The proof are basically propability and statistics, it needs to use Chebyshevâ€™s Inequalities, 4th moment bound and the variable independence derived from the 3/5-indenpendent hashing. If interested, this [stanford lecture note](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/cs166.1166/lectures/12/Small12.pdf) is very useful.
